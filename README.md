# origin-srs
The original Japanese Spaced Repetition System (SRS) Flashcard App created in Python.

Created to experiment with how to design an SRS app, more efficient ways to introduce new content to learn.
Due to the many flaws in the original application, I am now rewriting the it in Kotlin, with the goal of better data management, portability, and cleaner code.
